Create a program to calculate change in the payment process for a grocery store product.
The program must read the unit price of the product, the number of units purchased of this product,
and the cash value given by the customer. Your program must show the amount of change to be returned
to the client. If the money given by the customer is not enough, show a message informing the
remaining value as per example.
